If you like this blog you can find a tutorial on how to make one yourself [at this link](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/academic/). I highly recommend using Hugo for your static site needs. There are a ton of themes available and it is extremly fast to update. Hosting a Hugo static site on GitLab or GitHub Pages makes blogging super fast and the themes available look great. In addition it's super secure which is a huge advantage over a Wordpress blog.
